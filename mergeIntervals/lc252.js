// Problem Statement #

// Given an array of intervals representing ‘N’ appointments, find out if a person can attend all the appointments.

/*
Sort the array containing the intervals by the left number (start)
Have a condition to check if two intervals overlap
Condition: If the starting value of the next interval is between the two values of the previous interval
If they overlap: return false
If they don't overlap: return true
